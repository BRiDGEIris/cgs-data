strand_bias:
  description: How much evidence is there for Strand Bias (the variation being seen
    on only the forward or only the reverse strand) in the reads? Higher strand bias
    values denote more bias (and therefore are more likely to indicate false positive
    calls).

    from 1000 Genomes Project and other large-scale next-generation sequencing projects.).

vest_score:
  description: VEST 3.0 score. Score ranges from 0 to 1. The larger the score the
    more likely the mutation may cause functional change. In case there are multiple
    scores for the same variant, the largest score (most damaging) is presented. VEST
    predictions can be used to prioritize mutations by sorting VEST scores from largest
    to smallest. This will rank the mutations by similarity to the disease mutation
    class of the VEST training set versus the neutral class mutations. Please refer
    to Carter et al., (2013) BMC Genomics. 14(3) 1-16 for details. Please note this
    score is free for non-commercial use. For more details please refer to http://wiki.chasmsoftware.org/index.php/SoftwareLicense.
