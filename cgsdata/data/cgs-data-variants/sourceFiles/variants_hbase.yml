        ways of thinking about the depth of the data for this sample at this site.
        The Coverage field describe the total depth of reads that passed the Unified
        Genotypers internal quality control metrics (like MAPQ > 17, for example),
        whatever base was present in the read at this site. The allelic depths values
        (one for each of reference and alternative fields) is the count of all reads
        that carried with them the reference and alternative alleles. The reason for
        this distinction is that the coverage is in some sense reflective of the power

        depths tells me how many times I saw each of the reference and alternative
        alleles in the reads, free of any bias potentially introduced by filtering
        the reads.

        To be concrete, for the het case, this is L(data given that the true genotype

        it's P = 1.0 (0 when Phred-scaled), and the other likelihoods reflect their
