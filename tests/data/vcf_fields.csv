filters	In a perfect world, the Confidence field would be based on a complete model for all error modes present in the data used to call. Unfortunately, we are still far from this ideal, and we have to use orthogonal approaches to determine which called sites, independent of Confidence, are machine errors and which are real SNPs. Whatever approach is used to filter the SNPs, the VCFs produced by the GATK carry both the PASSing filter records (the ones that are good have PASS in their FILTER field) as well as those that fail (the filter field is anything but PASS or a dot). A variant won't pass GATK Standard filter if it met at least one of those conditions: - variant_confidence_by_depth < 2. - fisher_strand_bias > 60. - mapping_quality < 40. - haplotype_score > 13. - rank_sum_test_read_mapping_qual < -12.5. - rank_sum_test_read_pos_bias < -8.

confidence	The Phred scaled probability of Probability that reference/alternative polymorphism exists at this site given sequencing data. Because the Phred scale is -10 * log(1-p), a value of 10 indicates a 1 in 10 chance of error, while a 100 indicates a 1 in 10^10 chance. The GATK values can grow very large when lots of NGS data is used to call.	GATK 3.3	confidence	medium	CENTER	float		variants.quality	variants.quality	R.QUAL		QUAL

allelic_depth_ref	This and Coverage are complementary fields that are two important ways of thinking about the depth of the data for this sample at this site. The Coverage field describe the total depth of reads that passed the Unified Genotypers internal quality control metrics (like MAPQ > 17, for example), whatever base was present in the read at this site. The allelic depths values (one for each of reference and alternative fields) is the count of all reads that carried with them the reference and alternative alleles. The reason for this distinction is that the coverage is in some sense reflective of the power I have to determine the genotype of the sample at this site, while the allelic depths tells me how many times I saw each of the reference and alternative alleles in the reads, free of any bias potentially introduced by filtering the reads.

These are normalized, Phred-scaled likelihoods for each of the 0/0, 0/1, and 1/1, without priors. To be concrete, for the het case, this is L(data given that the true genotype is 0/1). The most likely genotype (the one in genotype) is scaled so that it's P = 1.0 (0 when Phred-scaled), and the other likelihoods reflect their Phred-scaled likelihoods relative to this most likely genotype.

cadd_phred	CADD phred-like score (-10*log10(rank/total)) based on whole genomeCADD raw scores. A scaled C-score of greater of equal 10 indicates that these are predicted to be the 10% most deleterious substitutions that you can do to the human genome, a score of greater or equal 20 indicates the 1% most deleterious and so on. If you would like to apply a cutoff on deleteriousness, you should put it somewhere between 10 and 20 (15). Please refer to Kircher et al. (2014) Nature Genetics 46(3):310-5 for details. The larger the score the more likely the SNP has damaging effect.

cadd_raw	CADD raw score for funtional prediction of a SNP. Raw CADD scores come straight from the model, and are interpretable as the extent to which the annotation profile for a given variant suggests that that variant is likely to be observed (negative values) vs simulated (positive values). These values have no absolute unit of meaning and are incomparable across distinct annotation combinations, training sets, or model parameters. However, raw values do have relative meaning, with higher values indicating that a variant is more likely to be simulated (or not observed) and therefore more likely to have deleterious effects. Please refer to Kircher et al.(2014) Nature Genetics 46(3):310-5 for details. The larger the score the more likelythe SNP has damaging effect.

vest_score	VEST 3.0 score. Score ranges from 0 to 1. The larger the score the more likely the mutation may cause functional change. In case there are multiple scores for the same variant, the largest score (most damaging) is presented. VEST predictions can be used to prioritize mutations by sorting VEST scores from largest to smallest. This will rank the mutations by similarity to the disease mutation class of the VEST training set versus the neutral class mutations.
